Using cv2 library images were resized and converted into array of numbers depicting the images. Matplotlib is used to show the pictures in the jupyter
notebook. Numpy is used to work with these arrays and flatten them. Then these arrays are feed into a logistic regression model, and hyperparameter tuning
was done extensively.
The result was around 0.60%.
